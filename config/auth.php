    | Authentication Guards
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Next, you may define every authentication guard for your application.
    | Of course, a great default configuration has been defined for you
    | here which uses session storage and the Eloquent user provider.
    |
    | All authentication drivers have a user provider. This defines how the
    | users are actually retrieved out of your database or other storage
    | mechanisms used by this application to persist your user's data.
    |
    | Supported: "session"
    |
    | EXPLANATIONS
    | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | By default, there are two guards namely web and api. Laravel supports two
    | types of authentication session-based and token-based (api authentication).
    | A guard key has an array for itâ€™s value and that array has two key-value pairs.
    | First driver and second is provider.
    |
    | Providers are used to define how our users will be retrieved and how
    | the user data with be stored after authentication. Laravel supports
    | eloquent and database drivers. We are using eloquent so we will define
    | the model that will be used for authentication and if you want to use the
    | database driver then you will need to define the database table where the
    | users are stored.
